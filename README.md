# OriClone-1
A New Oric!

The Oric-1 and Atmos line of computers are something I loved as a kid, and I thought it about time there was a new one in my collection.

So I'm working on it, and sharing with the world.  As always, have fun!

Please note that the W65C22S version won't let the cassette port read tapes, I have no idea why yet.  In that case use the Rockwell version instead, or alternatively, use something like an Erebus or disk interface.
